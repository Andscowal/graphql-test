# graphql-test

Wanted to try out GraphQL for the first time. This is a backend only app that can be ran in localhost.
<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NodeJS/Express</li>
  <li>Express-GraphQL</li>
  <li>GraphQL/GraphiQL</li>
  <li>json-server</li>
</ul>

I really enjoy the GraphiQL interface, and I can easily see why everyone is so excited and raving about it. 
Instead of wasting resources on returning every piece of data from a RESTful API, GraphQL allows us to limit APIs to return **only**
what we need. It saves time, headaches, and resources, so I could easily see myself implementing this into my own development.

Hope you enjoy!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
